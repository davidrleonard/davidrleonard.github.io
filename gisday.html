  <h2>Description for my talk</h2>

  <p><strong>Let's talk details: How to sort, prepare and publish the data you work with every day</strong></p>

  <p>The movement by public agencies to publish their data in the open without ever being asked for it has changed the way residents understand and relate to government.<p/>

  <p>Despite the growing conversation about opening data, the nitty-gritty details are often neglected: How can officials identify useful data to publish? What format should they choose? What context should they add? Where does publishing fit into existing workflows? We'll talk about the specifics of doing all this with real examples, and discuss what comes after data is put out in the world.</p>

  <h2>My bio</h2>

  <p>Right now, I’m building a design system for web applications that gobble up data from huge, industrial machines at <a class="small-link" href="https://www.ge.com/digital/">GE Digital</a>.</p>

  <p>In the past, I’ve worked with some amazing people also debugging huge systems (mostly human ones):</p>

  <p>I spent a few years at <a class="small-link o" href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a> helping governments build systems that work for real people. We worked to simplify the criminal justice system so people could get out of jail and stay out of jail, to remove barriers for people who want to improve their home, but don’t understand the permits and inspections required before they start, and on some other complex problems.</p>

  <p>Long ago, in a far-off land (&hellip; Kentucky), I worked in media designing digital news apps and newspaper pages for <a class="small-link bd" href="http://www.gannett.com/">Gannett</a>. I was even a reporter for a bit, with a pen and a skinny notepad and everything.</p>
